      <p>In poor areas, crime rates and violence are known to be higher. In the first half of the 1900s, many crimes such as bank-robbing, illegally selling alcohol, loan-sharing, and murder. Gangs that would perform petty crimes formed in poorer areas, and over time these gangs grew in number and power.</p>
      <br>          
      <p>Gang formation and recruiting occurred mainly at the place where senior members were most likely to find healthy youth: schools. In Chicago, where gang violence is most prevalent and dangerous, three major black gangs formed. Two of these gangs, the Vice Lords and the Black P-Stone Nation/Black Stone Rangers, were created in the Illinois State Reformatory School at Saint Charles. By the 60’s, these black street gangs grew so large in power that they threatened the entire community. They preyed on whoever they felt infringed on their livelihood or power, and they used extreme violence and criminal activity to control the town.</p>
      <br>          
      <p>The fear instilled by these groups made being a part of a gang the safest option for many children. There was no point in resisting them, as that would simply result in harm to one’s family. While the growth of gangs can partially be attributed to the racial and social unrest that existed at the time, many different black communities reacted differently. Much of the protest was non-violent, but gangs in Chicago chose to use violence instead.</p>
      <br>          
      <p>Gangs kept the youth from getting valuable education. School Grounds themselves were warzones, with opposing gangs causing violence on campus. Many students would not attend school as they feared the gangs that lurked the hallways, and others simply dropped out to participate in gang activities.</p>

      <p><i>Data from the North Carolina Public School Executive Summary demonstrating the low academic performance of schools with a large poverty percentage. </i></p>     
    <br>
      <p>For a period of time after The Great Depression and economic recovery in the 1930s and 1940s, with the increase in taxes to fund welfare and federal safety net programs, the income inequality rate in the United States decreased and the financial discrepancy between the Rich and Poor of America seemed to be repairing.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Unfortunately, the wealth concentrations of the early 21st century seem to directly mirror the trends just 100 years ago and many are tagging the status quo as the “new Roaring 20s”. The easy answer to why society is so financially stratified is due to modern day capitalism. With the growth of tech giants and large corporations such as Apple, Google, Facebook, and more, the leaders and high level executives behind them only get wealthier compared to the rest of the workforce. In fact, these ultra-rich top 0.1% of American Citizens have increased their wealth from 10% of total national wealth to 22% today, a dramatic increase.</p>  
      <br>
      <p>When the top 0.1% increases their wealth by double, other classes are bound to financially struggle in its wake. In this case, only the bottom 90% of people actually gave up money to fuel the rapid growth of the ultra rich. This ended up creating a new wealth class never seen before, the top 9.9%, a group of rich people that did not suffer at the hands of the growing wealth of the top 0.1%. These people in the top 9.9% lead great lives that really demonstrate the power of wealth in America. For example, they have lower chances of developing disease, higher chances of maintaining a stable family structure, higher levels of education, expanded rich social connections, and most importantly the ability to pass all of their generational wealth on to their children.</p>
      <br>
      <p>This leaves the people in the bottom 90% in a troubling situation. Because money and wealth are so generational, it is becoming increasingly more difficult for these people to climb the symbolic social ladder as they never had a chance to have the same education or opportunities as those who were born into rich families. Furthermore, with the growth of so-called “aristocrats” investing more and more of their money into Wall Street and financial assets as time goes on, effectively blocking out the lower classes’ accessibility to wealth. All of these structural barriers culminate to produce a society where income inequality is exacerbated and invincible. 
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>Even this year, the gap between the rich and the poor has grown tremendously, in ways that could never have been predicted. With the COVID-19 Pandemic, 74.7 million Americans have lost their jobs, a vast majority from the bottom 90%, causing approximately 25 million citizens to face real hunger and 37% of the adult population to rely on debt and loans to fund normal daily expenses, an incredibly dangerous course of action for the impoverished. While the poor are suffering under vastly suboptimal conditions surrounding the Pandemic, American billionaires, just 651 people, have grown their wealth by 1 trillion, an astounding 36% increase from prior. 
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>With the lack of significant government investment into improving structural assistance for the people in poverty, these trends are likely to continue. </p>
