      <p>In poor areas, crime rates and violence are known to be higher. In the first half of the 1900s, many crimes such as 
        bank-robbing, illegally selling alcohol, loan-sharing, and murder. Gangs that would perform petty crimes formed in 
        poorer areas, and over time these gangs grew in number and power.</p>
      <br>          
      <p>Gang formation and recruiting occurred mainly at the place where senior members were most likely to find healthy youth: 
        schools. In Chicago, where gang violence is most prevalent and dangerous, three major black gangs formed. 
        <a href = "https://www.sagepub.com/sites/default/files/upm-binaries/43455_1.pdf">Two of these 
          gangs</a>, the Vice Lords and the Black P-Stone Nation/Black Stone Rangers, were created in the Illinois State Reformatory 
        School at Saint Charles. By the 60’s, these black street gangs grew so large in power that they threatened the entire 
        community. They preyed on whoever they felt infringed on their livelihood or power, and they used extreme violence and 
        criminal activity to control the town.</p>
      <br>          
      <p>The fear instilled by these groups made being a part of a gang the safest option for many children. There was no point 
        in resisting them, as that would simply result in harm to one’s family. While the growth of gangs can partially be 
        attributed to the racial and social unrest that existed at the time, many different black communities reacted differently. 
        Much of the protest was non-violent, but gangs in Chicago chose to use violence instead.</p>
      <br>          
      <p>Gangs kept the youth from getting valuable education. School grounds themselves were warzones, with opposing gangs 
        causing violence on campus. Many students would not attend school as they feared the gangs that lurked the hallways, 
        and others simply dropped out to participate in gang activities.</p>

      <p><u><i>Image from US department of education showing the slow decline of gangs in schools.</i></u></p>     
    <br>
      <p>Today, not much has changed. Gang presence has been rapidly increasing and will continue to do so without proper 
        intervention. However, gang presence in schools is on a slow decline. Over the past few decades, the presence of 
        gangs in middle and high schools has slowly began to <a href = "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12103-019-09485-5">decrease</a>, in terms of percentage.Between 2009 and 2019, the 
        percentage of students ages 12–18 who reported that gangs were present at their school during the school year 
        decreased overall <b>(from 20 to 9 percent)</b>, as well as for students who were White <b>(from 14 to 6 percent)</b>, 
        Black <b>(from 31 to 15 percent)</b>, Hispanic <b>(from 33 to 12 percent)</b>, and Asian <b>(from 17 to 4 percent)</b>>.</p>
      <br>
      <p>This doesn’t necessarily mean that less students are participating in gang activities, as many schools in poorer 
        neighborhoods report low enrollment rates some years. Additionally, while individual schools have a lower gang presence, 
        the number of schools with gang presence has overall increased. <a href = "https://education.seattlepi.com/statistics-gangs-schools-2199.html">A study</a> released by the National Center on Addiction and 
        Substance Abuse reported that <b>45%</b> of high school students have gangs or gang members on their campuses. This 
        number has been increasing over time, as more gangs appear in cities.</p>  
      <br>
      <p><a href = "https://www.publicschoolreview.com/blog/the-latest-public-school-initiatives-against-gang-activity">Public education systems</a> have begun to combat gang violence. Many sports matches or events involving rival schools 
        tend to spur violence, so public schools in Chicago have started to cancel them. Additionally, one school changed 
        it’s schedule so that students riding the public bus would not encounter students from rival schools. They have also 
        implemented “gang-free” zones for students, and encourage extracurricular activities for the students to stay busy.</p>
      <br>
      <p>While the problem has been getting worse, we finally have a sense of improvement for the large gang violence problem 
        that exists among the youth in schools.
