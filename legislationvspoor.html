            Welfare programs mainly started in the 1930’s. Between 1932 and 1935, Presidents Hoover and Roosevelt passed many legislations which aimed to relieve states and their individuals of stress during times of economic recession. Many of these policies included writing checks to help the state ventures and individuals within states. Over the next few decades, more policies following the philosophy of the originals emerged, and became more involved with the individual. While these programs were intended to benefit all, the racist environment led to lots of discrimination.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many of the past social programs required people to be working or earning certain reported income to be eligible fro welfare programs. WHile this was not a problem for many, it became one for many blacks and hispanics. They were less likely to receive jobs because of their race, and were often paid “off the books” or in cash, which prevented them from access to these programs. Furthemore, some programs had residency requirements, and due to other policies that barred blacks from moving into different neighborhoods, black families were not eligible for a lot of programs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many whites prospered under the programs, which did a good job of helping the impoverished feed themselves and find work. Because of a simple misunderstanding of black families and culture, and the notion that anyone who works hard can be able to alleviate themselves from poverty, black families got little help. While whites prospered and found pathways out of the poverty cycles, blacks and hisapnics dug deeper holes as they received no help. While this will eventually change, racism and discrimination in welfare will prevail.

              In the late 1910s and early 1920s, courts often ruled in favor of businesses instead of workers. This was even the case during 1918 Hammer v Dagenhart, where Ronald Dagenhart tried to invoke the 10th amendment to enforce a profit when his child was involved with selling a product. He lost the case, and legislation ruled against the poor once again. Calvin Coolidge’s presidential realm came at a time where most of the poor, mainly farmers, suffered while most of the rich were prospering. In fact, it was during his regime that the highest income inequality rate to that date occurred as by 1928, the top one percent of families received 23.9% of all pre-tax income, while about 60% made less than $2,000 annually, which was the minimum livable amount for a family.
            </p>
            <p>
              After being elected President, Coolidge’s first action was limited aid to farmers. In fact, Coolidge explicitly stated that “well, farmers have never made much money” as reasoning to limit government resources to help them. A farm relief bill was created and backed by the secretary of Agriculture, Henry C. Wallace in 1923-1924, but was ultimately rejected by Congress, leaving farmers helpless. In subsequent years, Coolidge killed off two more farm relief bills, leaving those in poverty in shambles throughout the whole decade. Here, a lack of governmental help towards the farming community increased poverty, and rather prioritized the rich with government funding. 
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to blocking multiple plans for farm relief, Coolidge killed a plan to produce cheap Federal electric power on the Tennessee River. The Muscle Shoals Bill was created to build a dam in the Tennessee River and sell cheaper government-produced electricity. While Congress passed the bills, both presidents Coolidge and Hoover killed the idea because they didn’t want to waste resources and rather preferred private enterprises to fill that void. Despite not willing to shed money on the electricity, Coolidge did sign two revenue acts that reduced taxes on the wealthy. By keeping the cost of energy higher, legislation once again harmed the poor during the 1920s as it forced those already making under $2,000 annually to divert a significant portion of their budget to cover energy costs, which often raised the prices of other necessities as well. In addition, by choosing to reduce taxes on the wealthy, legislation chose to divert funds away from the poor and to benefit the rich, not combatting the glaring problem of income inequality.
