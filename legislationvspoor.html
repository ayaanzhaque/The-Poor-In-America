      <p>For as long as America has been an independent nation, economic and social inequalities between the rich and poor of America have made up the very fabric of society. The issues of economic disparity were only exacerbated during the early 1900s and the Roaring 20s (1920s).</p>
      <br>          
      <p>The roots of this divide between the upper and lower classes began in the late 1800s in an era called the Gilded Age. The Federal Government practiced non-interventionist, laissez faire economic policy that essentially allowed the market to function by itself with minimum regulation or constraints. This governmental decision prompted a rise in the power and wealth of the upper class while decreasing that the working class. The rich who owned corporations were able to build up monopolies and large corporations that could set their own high prices, lower their workers’ wages, and increase the working hours of their employees. As a result of the rise of large multifaceted companies that dictated and practically controlled the markets, their owners profited immensely. The top 1% of society held a staggering 38.6% of all money and 4000 families held as much wealth as the rest of the 11.6 million. </p>
      <br>          
      <p>The problem of wealth disparities grew and reached a peak during the Roaring 20s. In fact many historians believe that The Great Depression truly began in the 1920s for many of American Citizens, especially for those in the lower classes. The major reason fueling this lack of prosperity for the impoverished started from an overproduction of goods. During the First World War, both the agricultural and manufacturing had produced an abundance of crops and goods to keep pace with demand from domestic corporations and consumers in addition to America’s European Allies. Unfortunately for these industries, the demand for the overproduced goods and services did not keep up with the supply. Thus, a vicious cycle of overproduction was created to increase profit and therefore consumers were not able to afford a lot of the goods they wanted. Furthermore, the workers were not able to demand higher wages and lower wages due to the tremendous corporations maintained since the times of the Gilded Age.</p>
      <br>          
      <p>Therefore the 1920’s were only “Roaring” for the very limited wealthy American citizens while the ordinary Americans struggled in one of the worst occurrences of income inequality of all of the Nation’s existence. In fact 60% of the Nation’s families earned less than the necessary amount required to support themselves. Meanwhile the percentage of wealth held by the rich jumped up from 12% to 19% during the 1920s.</p>

      <p><i>Data from the North Carolina Public School Executive Summary demonstrating the low academic performance of schools with a large poverty percentage. </i></p>     
    <br>
      <p>For a period of time after The Great Depression and economic recovery in the 1930s and 1940s, with the increase in taxes to fund welfare and federal safety net programs, the income inequality rate in the United States decreased and the financial discrepancy between the Rich and Poor of America seemed to be repairing.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Unfortunately, the wealth concentrations of the early 21st century seem to directly mirror the trends just 100 years ago and many are tagging the status quo as the “new Roaring 20s”. The easy answer to why society is so financially stratified is due to modern day capitalism. With the growth of tech giants and large corporations such as Apple, Google, Facebook, and more, the leaders and high level executives behind them only get wealthier compared to the rest of the workforce. In fact, these ultra-rich top 0.1% of American Citizens have increased their wealth from 10% of total national wealth to 22% today, a dramatic increase.</p>  
      <br>
      <p>When the top 0.1% increases their wealth by double, other classes are bound to financially struggle in its wake. In this case, only the bottom 90% of people actually gave up money to fuel the rapid growth of the ultra rich. This ended up creating a new wealth class never seen before, the top 9.9%, a group of rich people that did not suffer at the hands of the growing wealth of the top 0.1%. These people in the top 9.9% lead great lives that really demonstrate the power of wealth in America. For example, they have lower chances of developing disease, higher chances of maintaining a stable family structure, higher levels of education, expanded rich social connections, and most importantly the ability to pass all of their generational wealth on to their children.</p>
      <br>
      <p>This leaves the people in the bottom 90% in a troubling situation. Because money and wealth are so generational, it is becoming increasingly more difficult for these people to climb the symbolic social ladder as they never had a chance to have the same education or opportunities as those who were born into rich families. Furthermore, with the growth of so-called “aristocrats” investing more and more of their money into Wall Street and financial assets as time goes on, effectively blocking out the lower classes’ accessibility to wealth. All of these structural barriers culminate to produce a society where income inequality is exacerbated and invincible. 
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>Even this year, the gap between the rich and the poor has grown tremendously, in ways that could never have been predicted. With the COVID-19 Pandemic, 74.7 million Americans have lost their jobs, a vast majority from the bottom 90%, causing approximately 25 million citizens to face real hunger and 37% of the adult population to rely on debt and loans to fund normal daily expenses, an incredibly dangerous course of action for the impoverished. While the poor are suffering under vastly suboptimal conditions surrounding the Pandemic, American billionaires, just 651 people, have grown their wealth by 1 trillion, an astounding 36% increase from prior. 
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>With the lack of significant government investment into improving structural assistance for the people in poverty, these trends are likely to continue. </p>

          <p>
            In the late 1910s and early 1920s, courts often ruled in favor of businesses instead of workers. This was even the 
            case during 1918 Hammer v Dagenhart, where Ronald Dagenhart tried to invoke the 10th amendment to enforce a profit 
            when his child was involved with selling a product. He lost the case, and legislation ruled against the poor once 
            again. Calvin Coolidge’s presidential realm came at a time where most of the poor, mainly farmers, suffered while 
            most of the rich were prospering. In fact, it was during his regime that the highest income inequality rate to that 
            date occurred as by 1928, the top one percent of families received <b>23.9%</b> of all pre-tax income, while about <b>60%</b> made 
            less than <b>$2,000</b> annually, which was the minimum livable amount for a family.
          </p>
          <p>
            After being elected President, Coolidge’s first action was limited aid to farmers. In fact, Coolidge explicitly stated 
            that <i>“well, farmers have never made much money”</i> as reasoning to limit government resources to help them. A farm 
            relief bill was created and backed by the secretary of Agriculture, Henry C. Wallace in 1923-1924, but was ultimately 
            rejected by Congress, leaving farmers helpless. In subsequent years, Coolidge killed off two more farm relief bills, 
            leaving those in poverty in shambles throughout the whole decade. Here, a lack of governmental help towards the farming 
            community increased poverty, and rather prioritized the rich with government funding. 
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to blocking multiple plans for farm relief, Coolidge killed a plan to produce cheap Federal electric 
            power on the Tennessee River. The Muscle Shoals Bill was created to build a dam in the Tennessee River and sell 
            cheaper government-produced electricity. While Congress passed the bills, both presidents Coolidge and Hoover 
            killed the idea because they didn’t want to waste resources and rather preferred private enterprises to fill that 
            void. Despite not willing to shed money on the electricity, Coolidge did sign two revenue acts that reduced taxes 
            on the wealthy. By keeping the cost of energy higher, legislation once again harmed the poor during the 1920s as it 
            forced those already making under $2,000 annually to divert a significant portion of their budget to cover energy 
            costs, which often raised the prices of other necessities as well. In addition, by choosing to reduce taxes on the 
            wealthy, legislation chose to divert funds away from the poor and to benefit the rich, not combatting the glaring 
            problem of income inequality.

              In 1996, Bill Clinton signed the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act, which was meant to move families 
              from welfare to work. In the late 1990s, there was some success, but 25 years later, the program has been regarded 
              as a failure in regard to helping the poor. While the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) was a program 
              created specifically to help those in need get work, only <b>8%</b> of TANF’s total funding goes toward employment 
              preparation services. In addition, as the cost of living has increased over the 25 year span, TANF’s funding hasn’t 
              increased at all, but rather has stayed stagnant at $16.5 billion. When the program began in 1996, two thirds of 
              families with children living below the poverty line were helped by TANF, but currently, less than one fourth of 
              those same families are being helped by the welfare program, a significant decline.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition, other government legislation like the energy and environmental policy have attributed to the ongoing 
              poverty impacting those in need. Policies and government regulations have caused more Americans to shift bills 
              towards energy costs, rather than necessities like food and medical insurance. Americans with incomes of under 
              <b>$30,000</b> after taxes reportedly spent <b>23%</b> of their budget towards energy costs, compared to the measly 
              <b>7%</b> of the middle and upper classes. Since energy is such an essential in the economy, increases in energy 
              prices stemming from governmental policies have also led to increases in price for food, healthcare, education, 
              clothes and other important daily needs. The Department of Energy(DOE) regulates sixty different products as a 
              result of the 1975 Energy Policy and Conservation Act, and these regulations have not been kind to the poor. The 
              DOE’s regulations best work for families who can pay more upfront, which are mainly middle and upper class, and in 
              return give more long-term benefits to incentivize that action. However, this comes at a disadvantage for the poor, 
              swho can’t afford to pay more upfront, and therefore have to use more of their budget to cover their energy costs. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Along with the energy and environmental policy, the government’s food and agriculture policy, specifically the 
              Federal Sugar Program, contributes to the poverty issue. The federal government has wanted to limit the amount of 
              sugar made in the U.S., attributing a price support to limit the amount sold and imported into the U.S. As a result, 
              the price of sugar has raised to double the world prices, and while it helps sugar growers, the rest of the economy 
              suffers from the governmental policy. In addition, this harms sugar-using industries, and increases the prices of 
              food involving sugar, which harms the poor the most, as a greater share of their income goes towards food purchases 
              when compared to people in higher social classes. The government’s intentional regulation on supply has made life 
              difficult, specifically for the poor, describing another way in how legislation has directly harmed those facing 
              poverty. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Recently, several states have started increasing their minimum wage as a form of legislation to help the poor. 
              California and New York have raised the price to $15 an hour, while Arizona, Colorado, and Maine have all raised 
              their minimum wage to $12 an hour. While this may seem like helpful legislation for the poor, it actually will 
              harm the community as a whole in the future. When the price for workers increases, the result is a loss of job 
              availability due to the reluctance to increase the cap for payroll, and if workers cannot get that first opportunity, 
              those chances to rise out of poverty into a second or third job decrease significantly, keeping many more still in 
              poverty. By 2023, California’s new $15 minimum wage is expected to eliminate 900,000 jobs, while New York’s increase 
              is expected to eliminate over 400,000 jobs. In fact, this policy will hit the least educated people of society the most. 
              As companies are required to pay more for minimum wage workers, they may be more inclined to hire a person of more 
              education like a high school graduate because they are already spending more money, which in result could freeze 
              vulnerable workers from the workplace, not solving poverty.
